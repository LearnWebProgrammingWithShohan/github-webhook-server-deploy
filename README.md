## github-webhook-server-deploy

## Steps

# Github - project source code manage - version control system
  - we do git install first in our local machine ( gui, cli )
  - we do write code for our project
  - when needed we create branches, at last we merge all our branches codes into master

# Webhook - a service through http - where we can send some information as response in real time

# Server access - domain - hosting - project deploy
  - server settings related stuffs - domain hosting configurations
  - git integration - ssh protocol for private repo - https for public repo

# Github - added ssh key which was retrieved from server hosting "git feature"
  - add webhook url which was retrieved from your server to github webhook in your project repository
